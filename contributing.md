## Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [v2.0.0]. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.


**Happy coding**!
